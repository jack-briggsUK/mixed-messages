# Mixed Messages

## Scope

Mixed Messages is a JavaScript program to generate a random message whenever the program is run.

## Message information

The random message that is returned happens to be in a language that nobody speaks.
I had thought about returning random words in a specified language but didn't know how to or really want to inport multiple complete dictionaries.
